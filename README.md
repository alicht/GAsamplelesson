Looking at concept of inheritance and how it relates JavaScript. When we code we want to build something that has a vast amount of objects, all of whom share a small bit of similiar functionality. Javascript provides us witha  very nice blueprint object that will pass those similiar properties to every single one of the objects we have made. 

-the objects we've built so far have some secret properties we've never seen before. These objects we're given properties just as soon as we've created them. ex: valueOf, constructor, toString, isProtoTypeOf. 

All of these come from an object's prototype. When a generic object is creted it's passed many important properties.

INHERITANCE- passing down properties is called inheritance.
Inheritance helps prevent overcoding multiple properties and methods into similiar objects.

All of the native JS data structures we've been learning about- like Array, String, Function, etc- inherit their properties and methods from their very own prototypes... and all those inherit from the Object prototype.
